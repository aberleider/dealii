Changed: mapping.h referred to different kinds of mappings in an enum 
MappingType; however, since it's an enum, MappingType is a misleading name. 
All instances of MappingType and mapping_type have been changed to 
MappingKind and mapping_kind, respectively. The documentation has been 
updated in order to reflect these changes as well.
