Changed: 
1. Add the HDG overview article in the references.bib file.The overview article is by N.C. Nguygen and J. Peraire: Hybirdzable discontinuous Galerkin methods for partial differential equations in continuum mechanics, Journal of Computational Physics, 2012.  
2. In the introduction part of step-51, I replace the above article by its referenced name.
